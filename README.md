# FocusFlow

Minimal Pomodoro-style timer built with React and Vite. Switch between focus, short break, and long break sessions, adjust durations on the fly, and keep the UI clean with a glassy overlay

## Features
- Three modes: Pomodoro, short break, long break
- Start/pause, reset, and per-mode duration controls via settings
- Crisp timer display with tabular numerals for easy reading
- Responsive layout with background artwork

## Usage Notes
- Use the mode buttons to swap between focus and breaks, switching resets the timer for that mode
- Open the gear icon to set custom durations (minutes), they apply when saved
- The reset icon restores the current mode to its default/last saved value
